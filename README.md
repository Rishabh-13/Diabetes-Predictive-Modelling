# Diabetes-Predictive-Modelling
Predicting diabetes using classification techniques in machine learning.

## Objective
Objective of this project is to classify the dataset for diabetes with highest accuracy possible.
This is proposed to be achieved through machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
Dataset is obtained from Kaggle, originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.  
In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.  
#### Features:
>Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant  
>Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test  
>BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)  
>SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)  
>Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)  
>BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)  
>DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function 
>Age: Age (years)  
>Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)  

## Library used:  
Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn

## Classification Techniques used:
Logistic Regression, Random Forest, KNN (Â k-nearest neighbors), Support Vector Machine (SVC)
